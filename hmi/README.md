# Webapp development principles

The webapp development is based on 2 main ideas:
- components (thereafter we use rather the word control)
- services

A control may need one or severals services to work which themselves may need over services to work.

## Controls

Controls are javascript code whose goal is to manage a part of the HTML DOM. A control can be instantiated as many times as you want in your webapp (WEB page).

In theory a webapp should consist of one main control which itself consists of one or severals controls.

Example of the system webapp users break down:

For now, the HeaderControl is part of the webapp skeleton generated by the server so you don't need to worry about it.

## Services

Services are javascript object which are instanciated automatically by the framework when first needed.

Services may be configured at webapp startup in the **configReady** function before any controls creation.

## A word to the files tree

the sources of the front-end are located in the **src** directory.
The **dist** folder is the result of the build which is based on GULP task runner.

The sources of the Webapp are located in the **src/pages** directory.
The sources of the common controls libraries are located in the **src/controls** directory.
The sources of the common services library are located in the **src/services** directory.


# Create a new Webapp

To create a new Webapp, first create a new folder in the **src/pages** directory.

In this directory, create a new javascript file with the following code:
